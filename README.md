# Workshop pizza helper

To use this script, simply run it by doing `python3 pizza.py` (on Linux/MacOS), or `python pizza.py` on Windows.

Then, fill up the asked information.

The script outputs the mail to send in the `order.txt` file. You can then copy paste this mail, and send it to the address <p42@dieci.ch>

Script originally written by Antoine Reynaud, rewritten in Python by Adrien Gunther
